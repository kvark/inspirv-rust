# inspirv-mir

An experimental compiler from [Rust] to [SPIR-V], based on rustc + Rust [MIR].

**This doesn't do anything useful yet.**

## Hacking notes

I recommend that you install [rustup] and then use it to
install the current rustc nightly version:

**Tested with nightly 2016-06-04**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/brson/mir2wasm.git
cd mir2wasm
rustup override set nightly-2016-06-04
```

```sh
cargo build
```

```sh
cargo run -q -- rust-examples/nocore-hello-world.rs
```

Do println debugging with `debug!` so it goes to stderr and print it like:

```
RUST_LOG=mir2wasm cargo run -q -- rust-examples/nocore-hello-world.rs
```

```
rustc -Z unstable-options --unpretty=mir rust-examples/nocore-hello-world.rs
```

[rustc docs](https://manishearth.github.io/rust-internals-docs/rustc/index.html).

Plug this stuff into a wast file to print something:

```
  (import $print_i32 "spectest" "print" (param i32))
  (export "foo" $foo)
...
    (call_import $print_i32 (get_local $1))
```

## Resources

* [miri](https://github.com/solson/miri) the MIR interpreter. mir2wasm is derived
  from it but shares no actual code. It probably should share code though, and
  there's lots to learn from miri.
* [rustc_trans::mir](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/librustc_trans/mir).
* [roadmap discussion](https://github.com/brson/mir2wasm/issues/17).
